## 📦 What is BeProx?

BeProx is a handy developer tool that acts as a Local Domain Proxy. It connects custom domains, like myapp.local, to your local services, such as localhost:5173. This tool makes development easier by allowing you to use `.local` domains and provides public URLs. We also plan to add advanced traffic inspection features.
